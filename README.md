# My Portfolio Website ðŸ˜Ž

## My Goal

My objective was to build a Portfolio Website of my own from scratch. In today's world, for an engineering graduate specialized in Computer Science & Engineering, it is recommended to have a separate portfolio website. Like a RESUME is considered in offline mode, a portfolio website is treated as an online RESUME, representing ones education, experience and projects. I have created this website using the concepts of FullStack. The frontend part of the website is created using HTML, CSS & Bootstrap and the backend part of the website is covered using the concepts of JavaScript language.

## What I have created
